# Bashcap Development Documentation

This project has multiple documentation files. Here's how to use them:

## 📚 Documentation Guide

### For First-Time Setup
**Start here:** [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md)
- Get up and running in hours, not days
- Minimal viable setup instructions
- Quick fixes for immediate blockers
- Choose your development path (demo vs MVP vs production)

### For Structured Development
**Follow this:** [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)
- Phase-by-phase implementation plan
- Clear dependencies and progression (Week 1 → Week 2 → etc.)
- Time estimates for each task
- Priority levels with visual indicators
- Organized by workflow stages (Foundation → Security → Production)
- Includes "Quick Start Path" for fastest route to working app

### For Complete Reference
**Consult this:** [IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md](IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md)
- Comprehensive list of ALL tasks (100+)
- Organized by priority levels
- Detailed breakdown of every category
- Good for tracking progress
- More granular than the roadmap

## 🎯 Which Document Should I Use?

### "I just want to see it work"
→ [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) - Follow "Path A: Just Make It Work"

### "I want to build this properly"
→ [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) - Follow Phases 1-3, then decide on Phase 4

### "I need to know everything involved"
→ [IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md](IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md) - Complete reference

### "I need to plan a timeline/budget"
→ [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) - Has time estimates and decision points

## 📖 How to Read the Documentation

### Priority Levels Explained

| Symbol | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 🔴 CRITICAL | Blocks other work | Do first, don't skip |
| 🟡 IMPORTANT | Needed for production | Do before launch |
| 🟢 ENHANCEMENT | Nice to have | Can defer or skip |

### Time Estimates

| Symbol | Meaning | Typical Duration |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| ⏱️ S | Small | 1-4 hours |
| ⏱️ M | Medium | 1-3 days |
| ⏱️ L | Large | 1+ weeks |

## Common Workflows

### Scenario 1: Weekend Hackathon
1. Read QUICK_START.md
2. Follow "Path A: Just Make It Work"
3. Skip everything else
4. **Time:** 4-8 hours

### Scenario 2: Side Project Launch
1. Read QUICK_START.md first
2. Follow ROADMAP.md Phases 1-3
3. Use CHECKLIST.md to track progress
4. **Time:** 2-3 weeks

### Scenario 3: Production Deployment
1. Read all three docs
2. Make decisions at ROADMAP.md decision points
3. Complete all phases in ROADMAP.md
4. Check everything in CHECKLIST.md
5. **Time:** 4-6 weeks

## FAQ

**Q: Can I skip the ROADMAP and just use the CHECKLIST?**
A: Yes, but you might do things out of order and hit blockers. The ROADMAP handles dependencies for you.

**Q: The QUICK_START says 1 day, the ROADMAP says 2 weeks. Which is right?**
A: Different goals:
- QUICK_START = minimal demo (1 day)
- ROADMAP Phase 1-2 = MVP (1-2 weeks)
- ROADMAP Phase 1-4 = Production (4-6 weeks)

**Q: Do I need to do everything in the CHECKLIST?**
A: No! It's a complete reference. Use the ROADMAP to prioritize.

**Q: I'm stuck. Where do I get help?**
A: Check the specific document section:
- Code issues → QUICK_START "Common Questions"
- Planning issues → ROADMAP "Decision Points"
- Task clarification → IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST details

**Q: Can I modify the plan?**
A: Absolutely! These are guides, not rules. Adjust based on your needs, timeline, and resources.
